(** **** Exercise: 4 stars (hoare_asgn_wrong)  *)
(** The assignment rule looks backward to almost everyone the first
    time they see it.  If it still seems backward to you, it may help
    to think a little about alternative "forward" rules.  Here is a
    seemingly natural one:
      ------------------------------ (hoare_asgn_wrong)
      {{ True }} X ::= a {{ X = a }}
    Give a counterexample showing that this rule is incorrect
    (informally). Hint: The rule universally quantifies over the
    arithmetic expression [a], and your counterexample needs to
    exhibit an [a] for which the rule doesn't work. *)

Theorem hoare_asgn_wrong:
  exists a, ~ {{ fun st => True }} X ::= a {{ fun st => st X = aeval st a}}.
Proof.
  unfold not. unfold hoare_triple.
  exists (APlus (AId X) (ANum 5)).
  intros. 
  assert (ceval (X ::= APlus (AId X) (ANum 5)) (update empty_state X 0) (update (update empty_state X 0) X 5)) as eq.
    apply E_Ass. simpl. reflexivity.
  apply H in eq. simpl in eq. inversion eq. reflexivity.
Qed.
